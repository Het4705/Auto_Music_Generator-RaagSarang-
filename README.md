# Raag Sarang Automation with JavaScript
This project aims to automate the rendition of Raag Sarang using JavaScript. The program stores combinations of all the swars accepted in Sarang as a string and proceeds to play a musical note corresponding to each character of that string (swar).

## Functionality:
### Combination Generation: 
Combinations of all accepted swars in Raag Sarang are stored as a string.
### Musical Playback:
The program plays a musical note for each character (swar) in the generated string, thus automating the rendition of Raag Sarang.
